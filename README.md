# GW Coding Judge (WIP) https://gwjudge.herokuapp.com/
An online coding judge built to host problems and contests for the coding club at the Dr. G.W. Williams Secondary School. Inspired by https://dmoj.ca/

Navigate to the submission instructions to get started, submission instructions are as follows:

# Trying a Problem
To try a problem, click either on some of the recent problems, the problems tab for a list of all previous problems, or a previous contest box to try out problems from a specific contest.

Problems look like the image below, with a problem description, input specification, output specification, time constraint, and constraints on the input.

This information is all very necessary, so pay attention! Competitive programming is generally about taking some unknown input and solving the given problem. So for the example below, the two inputs are completely variable and aren't known by the coder beforehand. Thus, the coder has to craft a concrete solution that computes the correct outputs for each given input no matter what the input is. Usually, this is done through the coding languages' terminal, i.e. <code>Scanner()</code> in Java, or <code>input()</code> in Python, and outputs are given in a similar manner, <code>System.out.println()</code> in Java, or <code>print()</code> in Python.

To submit your code, simply paste it into the submission box on the right! The judge will output a verdict, usually WA if your code outputs a wrong answer, AC if your solution is accepted, TLE is the solution is too slow, or an error message if your program failed to compile.

The judge runs on multiple "test cases", which are essentially pre-made input data, following the specified input format for the problem, that the judge feeds through your code and checks if your code outputs a correct answer.

The judge also includes the problem author below the submission box, and some example test data/test cases for you to test your code with. These sample cases will help you see if your code outputs the correct answer and fast enough!

On the tips tab, you'll find some helpful tips for competitive programming for specific languages!
